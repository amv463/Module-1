# Example application

# Status: accepted

# Context:

The application created here uses functions from MongoDB and Node.js while 
also exploring the basic functions of Docker

# Decision:

This application was made to display basic operations for storing data
and adding items to a list by using Node.js and MongoDB together, while 
allowing the opportunity to experiment with Docker and its containers.

# Consequences:

The use of this application allows for a functional environment that can be 
deployed and used without requiring much effort or resources.
