# Node.js

# Status: accepted

# Context:

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript run-time environment 
that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser. In addition, this 
platform can be used to explore basic Docker container operations. 

# Decision:

Node.js is a very popular platform based on JavaScript that allows for networking
and server-side applications. The node image goes well with a MongoDB database,
due to its ease of use and flexibility. Because of this, I chose to go with 
Node.js over other software like PHP. 

# Consequences:

Due to the efficient use of Node.js, functional environments can be deployed
and used without requiring much effort or resources.
